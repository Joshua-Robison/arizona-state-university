# Arizona State University

This repository contains coursework from a machine learning and artificial intelligence certificate completed through Arizona State University.

The main files are jupyter notebooks consisting of the following:
- [bayesian machine learning](#Bayesian-Learning)
- [kMeans clustering methods](#K-Means-Clustering)
- [dynamic bayesian network](#Dynamic-Bayes)
- [convolutional neural network](#Convolutional-Neural-Network)

### [Bayesian Learning](https://github.com/Joshua-Robison/arizona-state-university/blob/main/notebooks/bayes_model.ipynb)
This example looks at binary classification. It uses the MNIST dataset (images 0 and 1) and Bayes formula to classify images.

### [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/Joshua-Robison/arizona-state-university/blob/main/notebooks/clustering_model.ipynb)
This example builds a k-means clustering model from scratch. It looks at different initialization methods to improve performance.

### [Dynamic Bayes](https://github.com/Joshua-Robison/arizona-state-university/blob/main/notebooks/dynamic_bayes_network.ipynb)
This example looks at a simple probabilistic problem and constructs a dynamic bayesian model to compute probabilities over time.

### [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/Joshua-Robison/arizona-state-university/blob/main/notebooks/cnn_model.ipynb)
This example builds a CNN model from scratch. It is used on the MNIST image dataset.
